# What is Digital Signal Processing? 
# 
# - The process whereby real world phenomena can be translated into digital data for analysis, manipulation, and synthesis.
# 
# - This is done by sampling a signal with an instrument like a camera or a microphone, which in turn generates a sequence of numbers that represent continuous variables in a domain like time, space, or frequency.
# 
# - The fourier takes a waveform and finds its recipe.

# Digital Noise Generator:
# 
# - Random noise is an important topic in both electronics and DSP. 
# 
# - A common need in DSP is to generate signals that resemble various types of random noise. 
# 
# - This is required to test the performance of algorithms that must in the presense of noise. 
# 
# - The heart of digital noise generation is the random number generator.
# 
# - Algorithms need to be tested using the same kind of data they will encounter in actual operations.

# - a signal is obtain by adding two random numbers to form each sample, i.e., noise_sample = RND
# 
# - the value of each sample is uniformly distributed between zero and one.
# 
# - Adjust the length of (def generate_samples) to add values from the random number generator.
# 
# - The three examples below shows a signal formed by taking 128 samples from this type of random number generator.

# The examples belows converts a uniform distribution to a Gaussian distribution.  In each sample is created by adding twelve values from the random number generator. The pdf of is very nearly Gaussian, with a mean of six, and a standard deviation of one.
# 
# - Signals formed from random processes usually have a bell-shaped pdf. This is called a normal distribution, a Gauss distribution, named after the great German mathematician, Karl Friedrich Gauss(1777-1855). 
# 

# The example below shows a more of a uniform distribution.

# The Fourier transform is commonly used to convert a signal in the time spectrum to a frequency spectrum. A Fourier Transform will break apart a time signal and will return information about the frequency of all sine waves needed to simulate that time signal.

# 
# y(t) = A * sin(2 * pi * f * t)
# y(t) is the y axis sample we want to calculate for x axis sample t.
